    "- What factors contribute to deviations from the defined optimal climb rate?\n",

Specifically, the validated files for the Airbus A319, A320, A321, and A330-200 will be used for analysis. The dataset contains training, validation, and testing files, and for this study, only the validation files will be selected to ensure unbiased results.\n",
